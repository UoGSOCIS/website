                    Roboticon is an annual event run in partnership with SOCIS and the
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/" >School of Computer Science</a>. It is an
                    exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more about the field of Computer Science by
                    designing and building <b>LEGO Mindstorms</b> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by
                    our undergraduate students. Under strict rules and time limits, teams of students are challenged to
                    build and program robots by sharpening teamwork skills and performing set tasks against a field of competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our First Place winners will receive a brand new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit and we will be giving away

                    attend. The School of Computer Science will loan and mail out LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits to teams that
