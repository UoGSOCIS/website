                We are a group of Computer Science students working to help grow our community of programmers at the University of Guelph. We coordinate with the Guelph <a href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/">School of Computer Science</a> in to help plan the future of our program. We also manage a number of on campus services for students like the SOCIS office which is a space for students to relax and do independant and group work.

                We run events throughout the year to build the community in the
                Computer Science department at Guelph. In the past we have run
                Hackathons, LANs and Paintballing. We are always looking for new events
                to run so if you have any thing you'd like to see us do let us
                know!
