                    We are a group of Computer Science students dedicated to bettering the coding community at the University of Guelph. We work closely with the <a href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/">School of Computer Science</a> in planning the future of our program with our focus on benefiting students. We also run community building events, tutorials and maintain the SOCIS office in Reynolds 0010.

                <h3>Our Role in the School of Computer Science</h3>
                <p>
                    Computer Science students have a voice inside the department and that
                    voice is SOCIS. At least one of our executives is at every department
                    meeting to give student input on the topics discussed. This has far
                    reaching effects on important topics like the future curriculum provided to CS and S.
                    ENG majors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we also help the department to run events like the annual SOCS
                    barbeque held every year in September to help welcome first year CS
                    students to the University.

            <p class="lead">We run events to bring CS students closer together.</p>
            <p>Every year SOCIS runs a number of events like Hackathons, LANs
                and movie nights that help to bring CS students closer together and build
                community in our small but growing College. You can keep up to date on
                these events through this site, our Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/UoGSOCIS/">group</a>,
                or our <a href="https://gryph.slack.com">slack</a> channel #SOCIS.</p>

            <p class="lead">CS Games</p>
            <p>
                Each year we send team(s) to compete in the <a href="http://csgames.org/">CS Games</a>,
                a computer science competition meant for university students from around North America.
                Competitions range from Computer Science related activities such as debugging or AI, to
                more non-computer related festivities like sports or video games.

            <hr class="grey">
            <p class="lead">CUSEC</p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of each year we raise the funding necessary to send students to the
                annual <a href="http://cusec.net/">CUSEC conference</a>. Whether students are interested in
                the event speakers, the on-site hackathon or simply just want to find a potential employer,
                CUSEC can offer them the best opportunities. Due to the conference being sponsored by the likes
                of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and more (all of which attend looking to hire), CUSEC is one
                of the best places for computer science students to go job hunting.
